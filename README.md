# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
Module 7 Challenge

## Overview of the Pewlett Hackard Analysis Project
The purpose of the Pewlett Hackard Analysis Project was to help Bobby share information with his manager related to volumes of retiring employees and to identify employees eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Specifically, the analysis intended to determine volume of retiring employees based on job title by considering the birthdate. Additionally, the mentorship program eligibility was also based on birth year 1965. In both analyses, it was necessary to filter the date to include only current employees based on the to_date column.


## Results
- 1549 current employees are eligible for the mentorship program.
- The highest volume of retiring employees are in the Senior Engineer job title, followed closely by Senior Staff.
- Only 2 managers are included in the retiring employees analysis.
- 72,458 total employees are included in the retirement eligibility prediction.

## Summary 

### "Silver Tsunami" Impact
Approximately 72,458 roles will need to be filled as a result of the retirements associated with the "Silver Tsunami." It's possible this number could be even higher if other employees consider early retirement and/or if productivity loss requires additional hiring needs.

### Mentorship Volumes
There are significantly less staff eligible to mentor new employees than there are job openings created by the "Silver Tsunami." 
- With 569 mentorship eligible Senior Staff, each eligible mentor would need to mentor ~ 40 new staff members in that role (based on 24,926 retiring Senior Staff).
- With 501 mentorship eligible Engineers, each eligible mentor would need to mentor ~18 new staff members in that role (based on 9,285 retiring Engineers).
- With 169 mentorship eligible Senior Engineers, each eligible mentor would need to mentor ~ 153 new staff members in that role (based on 25,916 retiring Senior Engineers).
- With 155 mentorship eligible Staff, each eligible mentor would need to mentor ~ 50 new staff members in that role (based on 7,636 retiring Staff).
- With 78 mentorship eligible Assistant Engineers, each eligible mentor would need to mentor ~ 14 new staff members in that role (based on 1,090 retiring Assistant Engineers).
- With 77 mentorship eligible Technique Leaders, each eligible mentor would need to mentor ~ 47 new staff members in that role (based on 3,603 retiring Technique Leaders).
- There are no mentorship eligible managers to mentor two newly hired future managers.
